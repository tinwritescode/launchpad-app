✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Techstacks

- [Nx](https://nx.dev/)
- [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)

## Development

After clone the repository, run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

Running docker (for the postgresql database):

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Or you can can use 3rd party database services like neondb.io and configure the `.env` file.

```
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:changeme@localhost:5432" # Change this
```

Running migrations:

```bash
yarn nx prisma-push app
```

If you want to access the database, you can use the following command:

```bash
yarn nx prisma-studio app
```


Running localnode:

```bash
yarn start contracts:node
```

Then, let's deploy the contracts:

```bash
yarn start contracts:deploy # make sure the localnode is running
```

Let's start the app:

```bash
yarn start app
```

For the dashboard:

```bash
yarn start dashboard
```

## Run development faster 

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Working with database:

Prisma db push:

```bash
yarn nx prisma-push app
```

Prisma db studio:

```bash
yarn nx prisma-studio app
```

Prisma seed:

```bash
yarn nx prisma-seed app
```

Prisma reset:

```bash
yarn nx prisma-reset app
```
