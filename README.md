# Outline of Thesis

In this thesis, we will be exploring a launchpad app that has been developed by a team of six members. The app introduction is in need of an update, and we will be diving into the specifics of what the launchpad app does, as well as the libs/contracts involved, which are smart contracts.

## Team

Firstly, let's take a look at the team behind the launchpad app. The team consists of six members, all of whom have been involved in the development process. We will delve into the specific roles of each member and how they contributed to the app's creation.

| Name | Main Role | Student ID |
| --- | --- | --- |
| John | Project Manager | 123456 |
| Jane | Frontend Developer | 234567 |
| Mike | Backend Developer | 345678 |
| Sarah | Blockchain Developer | 456789 |
| David | UX Designer | 567890 |

## App Introduction

The app introduction needs an update, and we will be discussing what needs to be added and how it can be improved. We will analyze the current state of the introduction and provide suggestions for how to make it more engaging and informative.

## Launchpad App

Next, we will be introducing the launchpad app itself. We will provide a comprehensive overview of what the app does and how it works. This will include an analysis of the key features and functionalities, as well as any limitations or drawbacks.

## Libs/Contracts

The launchpad app relies heavily on smart contracts, and we will be diving into the specifics of these contracts. We will analyze how they work and how they facilitate the app's functionality. Additionally, we will provide a discussion of any potential issues or concerns related to the use of these contracts.

## Install

In order to install the launchpad app, you will need to run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Running the App

Finally, we will provide a detailed guide on how to run the launchpad app. This will include instructions for using Running Docker and running the app. We will also provide troubleshooting tips for any potential issues that may arise during the running process.
